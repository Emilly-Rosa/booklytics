# 📚 Booklytics – Reading Dashboard with Power BI

This is a personal project created to organize and visualize my reading habits using Power BI. I wanted to better understand my reading patterns while practicing data visualization in a creative and personal way.

## 💡 About the Project

The interactive dashboard was built using a manually created dataset, with information such as:

- Reading format (Physical book, E-book, Comic book)
- Reading status (Read, Reading, Paused, Abandoned)
- Number of pages
- Literary genre
- Language
- Reading date

With this data, the dashboard shows insights into my reading preferences and behavior over time.
